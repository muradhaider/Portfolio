# About

Background:
As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of the Pacific in California. Despite being originally from Palestine, my upbringing in California has given me a unique cross-cultural perspective.
Starting as a Business major, I quickly transitioned to Computer Science after a captivating introduction to coding. Problem-solving and programming became my passion, and I realized that success in computer science comes from dedication and ongoing learning.
Looking ahead, I'm thrilled to share that I'll be pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Science at the University of the Pacific. This decision aligns perfectly with my goal to deepen my expertise in a field that I'm deeply passionate about. Through this advanced degree, I'm committed to refining my skills, engaging with complex concepts, and contributing to the evolving world of technology.
What am I doing now?
I am currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Science at the University of the Pacific, building upon the foundation of my Bachelor's degree. My academic journey is complemented by my roles in two dynamic positions:
Eco Light Trading Co. - Remote Data Analyst (May 2023 - Present):
Specializing in product analysis, optimization, and sales trends. Leveraging data analytics and Tableau for performance insights and demand alignment.
The Profit Brokers LLC. - Lead Algorithm & Indicator Developer (October 2018 - Present):
Leading diverse indicator development on trading platforms. Crafting automated trading systems for optimized portfolio management using Python, R, C++, and C#.
Computer Science Portfolio
The following will highlight some of the experience I have gained in my current years and it is forever growing. Some of my favorite projects are the mario game and a personal project I worked on to parse through an input file and sort the elements within it.

# Research and Projects 

Fall 2020 COMP 055 Application Development Semester Project
For this course, we worked on a game or application of our choice for the duration of the semester. Our only restrictions were that we needed to use Java in eclipse and work with github in order to commit, push, and submit work. 


My group and I ended up developing a 2D Tile game remake of Super Mario. This was intended to be a very simple and user-friendly project. We split the roles up and I mainly worked on physics, UI, and collision detection. 

Tools Used




Code 

This segment of code was particularly the most frustrating and time consuming on my behalf. However, I thankfully had a team so I was not alone in the process. We needed to make sure that the sprite character of our game did not simply go through the entities. We did this by creating hit boxes in order to detect when the entities or objects were being touched. Then we return the hitboxes of the entity passed. We were able to work well as a team in order to get through the collision detection due to the fact we had not done it ever before.  This elaborates on my teamwork and problem solving skills.

SPRING 2021 COMP 141 Programming Languages Python Parser Project

For this project I was already very curious about how stock scanners worked and upon doing some research I found there were many ways to parse and sort certain inputs. However, I was not advanced enough to learn how to import all the stock details necessary so this project allowed me to start small with a normal .txt input file and write a program to sort through the file and output the correct identifier for each token. 


The output of the program as you can see went through line by line and sorted each token or element in a line into its correct type. 















Tools Used



Code

The following code is the beginning phases of this project. There will be a link to the full project down below. This segment of code shows the different variables that we have and the scanner in order to go through each line and find a match for the correct variable or type. We also have the tokens which will set the items or tokens that matched  to the corresponding variable. We used python and repl to create this project and then we would run it using the shell.

Senior Project Futures Trading Algorithm
The system architecture consists of a single computer with Windows 10 or higher and NinjaTrader 8. The computer will be connected to a prop firm account, which will allow the user to access the NinjaTrader 8 strategy builder and C# environment. The futures trading algorithm will be designed and run in real-time using historical market data.

The Futures Trading Algorithm will be based on an object-oriented design using UML. The software design will consist of a class diagram showing all classes and their associations, including public and protected members. The main entry/exit condition of the algorithm will be based on the EMA and VMA crosses. These crosses will help determine the direction of the trend and provide signals for entering and exiting trades.

In addition to the EMA and VMA crosses, the algorithm will also incorporate the use of different candle types to reduce the number of trades taken in chop and filter price action. The use of stochastics and the dynamic nature of these indicators will also help to identify potential trades with a higher probability of success.

Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed to run in real-time using historical market data. This allows the trading strategy to be backtested and optimized prior to live trading. By using NinjaTrader 8 and the Rithmic Trader software, the user will have access to a variety of tools for analyzing and testing the performance of the algorithm. The software will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible to traders of all skill levels.

Tools Used









Code

The implementation of the code for this project was carried out using C# within the script editor of the NinjaTrader platform. The link provided below grants access to both the code itself and the associated project's wiki, which outlines the comprehensive steps undertaken to tackle this endeavor. Through the script editor, C# was utilized to construct a robust and dynamic solution, ensuring the project's objectives were met effectively. The wiki offers detailed insights into the iterative approach taken, highlighting the various tests conducted to refine and optimize the codebase. This project stands as a testament to the power of C# within the NinjaTrader environment, showcasing its capability to create intricate and efficient solutions for complex challenges. Access the link for a closer look at both the code and the thought process that drove its development.
